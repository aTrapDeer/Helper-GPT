# Helper GPT
## Smart Assistant for your computer - powered by OpenAI ChatGPT, Deepgram and LiveKit
### Have LLMs integrated into your computer to help you with your daily tasks. Screen visualizer and all around helper.

This is a project I'm working on for fun after watching the movie 'Her' to see what system architecture I could build to simulate a 'true' AI assistant. Of course, this is bounded by hardcoded values for certain operations and tasks, and LLMs aren't inherently 'smart' in the way that humans are but can we simulate and mock a human-like AI?

This will be a system that users can run on their computers to help them with their daily tasks. Will be implementing memory system with a SQLite database to store the data for the assistant to use. All information will be localized besides API calls to OpenAI, Deepgram and LiveKit.
